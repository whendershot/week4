Array Challenges
Objectives
Get comfortable with loops: for and while.
Get comfortable with conditionals: if/else.
Please work on the following challenges and upload your work when done.

Always Hungry
Write a function that is given an array and each time the value is "food" it should console log "yummy". If "food" was not present in the array console log "I'm hungry" once.
function alwaysHungry(arr) {
    // your code here 
}
   
alwaysHungry([3.14, "food", "pie", true, "food"]);
// this should console log "yummy", "yummy"
alwaysHungry([4, 1, 5, 7, 2]);
// this should console log "I'm hungry"copy
High Pass Filter
Given an array and a value cutoff, return a new array containing only the values larger than cutoff.
function highPass(arr, cutoff) {
    var filteredArr = [];
    // your code here
    return filteredArr;
}
var result = highPass([6, 8, 3, 10, -2, 5, 9], 5);
console.log(result); // we expect back [6, 8, 10, 9]copy
Better than average
Given an array of numbers return a count of how many of the numbers are larger than the average.
function betterThanAverage(arr) {
    var sum = 0;
    // calculate the average
    var count = 0
    // count how many values are greated than the average
    return count;
}
var result = betterThanAverage([6, 8, 3, 10, -2, 5, 9]);
console.log(result); // we expect back 4copy
Array Reverse
Write a function that will reverse the values an array and return them.
function reverse(arr) {
    // your code here
    return arr;
}
   
var result = reverse(["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]);
console.log(result); // we expect back ["e", "d", "c", "b", "a"]copy
Fibonacci Array
Fibonacci numbers have been studied for years and appear often in nature. Write a function that will return an array of Fibonacci numbers up to a given length n. Fibonacci numbers are calculated by adding the last two values in the sequence together. So if the 4th value is 2 and the 5th value is 3 then the next value in the sequence is 5.
function fibonacciArray(n) {
    // the [0, 1] are the starting values of the array to calculate the rest from
    var fibArr = [0, 1];
    // your code here
    return fibArr;
}
   
var result = fibonacciArray(10);
console.log(result); // we expect back [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
